<h2> About me </h2> <div class="photo" ><img src= "Dog.jpg" alt = "My crazy dogs" title= "My two Dogs" height="275" /></div>
<p> 
I am from Story City, IA, a small town just north of Ames. I went to Roland-Story High School 
and had a graduating class of 85. I played four sports in high school: football, basketball, 
track and baseball. I was also the FFA president. I have 2 older brothers: one is a principal
and the other is a basketball coach for UNI women's team. I chose to go to The University of 
Iowa to become a dentist. After taking a semester of chemistry, I changed my major to MIS.
</p>

<h2> College life </h2>
<p>
I am a senior at The University of Iowa majoring in BAIS, going down the IS track. 
I currently work at the ITS HelpDesk and have worked there since my freshman year 
of college. I enjoy working there because I literally learn/see something new every
day. I also work for SSG (student software group) for the HelpDesk where I reformat 
computers and various other IT work.
</p>

<h2> Future endeavours  </h2>
<p>
I have recently accepted an offer from John Deere in their IT Early Development program.
I am excited for the opportunity to work for a company like John Deere. Possibly in the 
future, I may pursue a Master's in Information system. But, I am sick of school so that 
may not be for awhile.
